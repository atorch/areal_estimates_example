Simulated examples of misclassification bias in areal estimates

See https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/31722

> Misclassification causes bias in these statistical areal estimates. For example, if a small percentage of a common cover type is misclassified as a rare cover type, then the area occupied by the rare type can be severely overestimated.
